Hello friends in this video I have made a 2-Axis camera slider, 

by using arduino stepper motor and some aluminium extrusion profile.


A rotary encoder and 0.96" oled display used for user interface

This the link of complete video you can watch the video from here where I have demonstrated complete steps

in order to build this cool arduino based DSLR Camera slider.

I have used the 12mm birch wood to made this side blocks, the dimensions are 60mm on top 

and 80mm on bottom, and have 20mm grove at the top center,

in this grove we can place our 20x20 alu. extrution profile. 

![MVI_0003 00_02_20_04 Still002](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19898602/125608925-fbc0463d-53c4-44e8-9fbc-153dd7f96b47.jpg)

This is the main part of our project this are the 20 x 20 Alu. extrution 
the length is as per your need means how long you want to travel camera you can keep
length as per that.

I have used two aluminium extrusion of 20x20 cross section size you can use 20x40 size as well

This is the camera slider platform

it have four V shape wheels on the all four corners this wheel fit in the grove of 20 x 20 alu extrusion profile.

I made this platform using 4 mm wood there is also a provision for nema 17 stepper motor.

this motor will pan the camera in 180 degree horizontally

This is the control unit box which I 3D printen in PLA filament 

its size is 75 x 55 mm I have placed my PCB inside this box and I placed a rotary encoder and 

small OLED screen on the cover of this control unit box 

This rotary encoder and small OLED screen is helpfull for user interface and to display  data on the screen
